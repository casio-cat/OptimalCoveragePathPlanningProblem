# OptimalCoveragePathPlanningProblem

## Prerequisites

### Python

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install pandas
```

### Matlab

Optimization Toolbox(https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/)

### GNU C

gcc 11.3.0

**Note**
If you are running this on windows mingw compiler doesn't work. GLKH is ported to this version of gcc with cygwin 3.3.5 and is primarily tested and run on this version.

## Code workings

run unfinished version

```bash
# go to the bottom of OCPPP.py
# change desired start, end and unpassable areas
# change mode = 0
python OCPPP.py
# go to Matlab command line and the main repository directory
OCPPP
# the following xh.csv would be the results of line segmentation of the workspace
# go back to OCPPP.py and change mode = 1
python OCPPP.py
# creates the transition segments and relative cost for GTSP and plots the line segments to segment.png
# go to Matlab again
GTSP
# the following GTSP_result.csv would be the results of GTSP w.r.t the line segments and transition segments
# to plot the results go back to OCPPP.py again and change mode = 2
python OCPPP.py
``` 
plot
```bash
# go back to the bottom of OCPPP.py
# change mode = 0
python OCPPP.py
```

run with Ramesh et al. configurations

```bash
# go to the bottom of OCPPP.py
# change desired start, end and unpassable areas
# change mode = 0
python OCPPP.py
# go to Matlab command line and the main repository directory
OCPPP
# the following xh.csv would be the results of line segmentation of the workspace
# go back to OCPPP.py and change mode = 1
python OCPPP.py

## test
the other files are the results using
```bash
unpassable = [[1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5], [5, 7], [5, 8], [6, 7], [6, 8]]
```

abstract={The equality generalized traveling salesman problem (E-GTSP) is an extension of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the set of cities is partitioned into clusters, and the salesman has to visit every cluster exactly once. It is well known that any instance of E-GTSP can be transformed into a standard asymmetric instance of the TSP, and therefore solved with a TSP solver. This paper evaluates the performance of the state-of-the art TSP solver Lin--Kernighan--Helsgaun (LKH) on transformed E-GTSP instances. Although LKH is used without any modifications, the computational evaluation shows that all instances in a well-known library of benchmark instances, GTSPLIB, could be solved to optimality in a reasonable time. In addition, it was possible to solve a series of new very-large-scale instances with up to 17,180 clusters and 85,900 vertices. Optima for these instances are not known but it is conjectured that LKH has been able to find solutions of a very high quality. The program's performance has also been evaluated on a large number of instances generated by transforming arc routing problem instances into E-GTSP instances. The program is free of charge for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code.},
